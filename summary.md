# CandyRush - Multiplayer Treasure Hunt Game

## What is CandyRush?

CandyRush is an exciting team-based treasure hunting game where players compete to collect the most points! Join one of four teams, explore the map, find treasure chests, defend NPCs from monsters, and battle epic bosses to become the ultimate champion!

## Game Overview

### Team-Based Competition
- **4 Teams**: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow

- **PvP Action**: Battle players from other teams
- **Time-Limited Rounds**: Each game lasts 20 minutes

### How to Earn Points

1. **Treasure Chests**

   - Regular chests give food items and points
   - Watch out for trapped chests that can damage you!

2. **Food Collection**

   - Watch out - they're tough!

5. **Murderer System (PvP Deterrent)**
   - Attacking non-Murderer players triggers severe penalties
   - Murderers have red names, cannot equip armor, and drop items on death
   - Killing a Murderer is penalty-free (self-defense)
