# Tasks: PVP Restriction Bug Fix

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fix-pvp-restriction/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included as they were not requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single Minecraft plugin project**: `src/main/java/com/candyrush/`, `src/test/java/com/candyrush/`
- Paths are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify existing project structure and dependencies

- [ ] T001 Verify Java 21 and Gradle build configuration in build.gradle
- [ ] T002 Verify Paper API 1.21.5 dependency in build.gradle
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify test dependencies (JUnit Jupiter, Mockito, MockBukkit) in build.gradle
- [ ] T004 [P] Run ./gradlew build to ensure project compiles successfully

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core refactoring that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Refactor PlayerManager.setMurderer() method to return boolean instead of using array wrapper in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T006 [P] Add setPlayerNameRed() helper method to PlayerManager in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T007 [P] Add setPlayerNameWhite() helper method to PlayerManager in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T008 Update PlayerManager.clearMurderer() to use setPlayerNameWhite() helper in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T009 Update PlayerManager.updatePlayerNameColor() to use setPlayerNameRed/White helpers in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T010 Add lastVictims map field to PvpListener class in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Immediate Murderer Status on PvP Attack (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Apply murderer status immediately when a player damages another non-murderer player, with team-based friendly fire prevention

**Independent Test**: Have one player attack another without killing them, and verify that murderer status, visual indicators (red name), and penalties (armor removal) are applied immediately upon damage. Test same-team attacks are blocked with no damage.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T011 [US1] Add onPlayerDamage event handler method skeleton to PvpListener in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement game state check in onPlayerDamage (verify game is running) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement entity type validation in onPlayerDamage (both must be players) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement self-damage check in onPlayerDamage (ignore if attacker equals victim) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement team affiliation check in onPlayerDamage (get both players' teams) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T016 [US1] Implement same-team damage cancellation in onPlayerDamage (cancel event if same team) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T017 [US1] Implement victim murderer status check in onPlayerDamage (allow attacking murderers) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T018 [US1] Call applyMurdererPenalty when victim is non-murderer in onPlayerDamage in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T019 [US1] Add setPlayerNameRed() helper method to PvpListener (duplicate from PlayerManager for convenience) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T020 [US1] Add setPlayerNameWhite() helper method to PvpListener (duplicate from PlayerManager for convenience) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T021 [US1] Update applyMurdererPenalty to use new setMurderer return value (boolean instead of array) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T022 [US1] Update applyMurdererPenalty to track last victim in lastVictims map in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T023 [US1] Update applyMurdererPenalty to call setPlayerNameRed on first-time murderers in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T024 [US1] Update applyMurdererPenalty announcement logic to handle first-time vs repeat vs same-victim cases in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T025 [US1] Add debug logging to onPlayerDamage for troubleshooting (INFO level) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Players can attack each other and murderer status applies immediately. Same-team attacks are blocked.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Proper Kill/Death Counting (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Record kill and death statistics correctly based on whether the victim was a murderer or regular player

**Independent Test**: Review player statistics after various PvP death scenarios - murderer kills should grant kill credit, regular player kills should not.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T026 [US2] Extract handlePvpDeath method from onPlayerDeath in PvpListener in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T027 [US2] Remove murderer status application logic from onPlayerDeath (this is now in onPlayerDamage) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T028 [US2] Implement murderer victim check in handlePvpDeath (check if victim was murderer) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T029 [US2] Implement kill credit logic for murderer victims in handlePvpDeath (increment killer kills, victim deaths) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T030 [US2] Implement death-only logic for non-murderer victims in handlePvpDeath (increment victim deaths only, no kill credit) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T031 [US2] Update team statistics in handlePvpDeath (increment team kills/deaths appropriately) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T032 [US2] Update broadcast announcement for murderer kills in handlePvpDeath in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T033 [US2] Add debug logging to handlePvpDeath for statistics tracking in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently. Murderer status applies on damage (US1), and statistics are counted correctly on death (US2).

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Murderer Status Management and Recovery (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Track murderer status with proper time accumulation, and restore normal status when timer expires

**Independent Test**: Track a player's murderer status over time, verify timer accumulation with repeated attacks, and confirm status removal when timer expires.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T034 [US3] Verify murderer timer accumulation logic in PlayerManager.setMurderer() (add 3 minutes per offense) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T035 [US3] Verify 60-minute cap logic in PlayerManager.setMurderer() (cap at maxUntil) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T036 [US3] Verify murderer status persistence across reconnects (PlayerData already persists murdererUntil to database) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T037 [US3] Verify existing scheduled task calls clearMurderer when timer expires (check existing timer cleanup code) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java or CandyRushPlugin
- [ ] T038 [US3] Verify clearMurderer properly resets status and calls setPlayerNameWhite (already updated in T008) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T039 [US3] Add logging for murderer status expiry in clearMurderer in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T040 [US3] Verify armor equipping prevention logic still works (existing InventoryClickEvent and PlayerInteractEvent handlers) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional. Murderer status applies immediately (US1), statistics are accurate (US2), and status management works correctly over time (US3).

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T041 [P] Remove or reduce debug logging statements added during development in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T042 [P] Remove or reduce debug logging statements added during development in src/main/java/com/candyrush/managers/PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T043 Code review: Verify all event handler priorities are correct (MONITOR for damage, NORMAL for death) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T044 Code review: Verify null-safety for team comparisons (handle null teams gracefully) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T045 Code review: Verify scoreboard team creation doesn't conflict with existing team system in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java and PlayerManager.java
- [ ] T046 Performance check: Verify damage event handler completes in <10ms (minimal database writes) in src/main/java/com/candyrush/listeners/PvpListener.java
- [ ] T047 Run manual testing scenarios from quickstart.md (same-team attack, murderer status, kill credit, etc.)
- [ ] T048 Run ./gradlew build to ensure all changes compile successfully
- [ ] T049 [P] Update CLAUDE.md if any new patterns or conventions emerged during implementation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Modifies same file as US1 but different methods - can work in parallel with coordination
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Primarily verification of existing functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks within US1 are mostly sequential (building up the onPlayerDamage handler step by step)
- Tasks within US2 are mostly sequential (refactoring onPlayerDeath method)
- Tasks within US3 are mostly parallel verification tasks

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T003 and T004 can run in parallel
- Phase 2: T006 and T007 can run in parallel (different helper methods)
- Phase 3 (US1): Most tasks are sequential due to building up logic in same method
- Phase 4 (US2): Most tasks are sequential due to refactoring same method
- Phase 5 (US3): T034, T035, T036, T037, T038, T040 can all run in parallel (verification tasks)
- Phase 6: T041, T042, and T049 can run in parallel

**Note**: While US2 and US3 could theoretically start in parallel with US1, they all modify PvpListener.java which creates merge conflicts. Recommended to complete sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3).

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all verification tasks for User Story 3 together:
Task T034: "Verify murderer timer accumulation logic in PlayerManager.setMurderer()"
Task T035: "Verify 60-minute cap logic in PlayerManager.setMurderer()"
Task T036: "Verify murderer status persistence across reconnects"
Task T037: "Verify existing scheduled task calls clearMurderer when timer expires"
Task T038: "Verify clearMurderer properly resets status"
Task T040: "Verify armor equipping prevention logic still works"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verify environment)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - refactor base methods)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (immediate murderer status + team protection)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Manual testing per quickstart.md scenarios
5. Test independently: same-team attacks blocked, murderer status on damage
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! Core bug is fixed)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Statistics now accurate)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Status management validated)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Sequential Team Strategy (Recommended)

Due to file conflicts in PvpListener.java:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational together
2. Complete User Story 1 fully (core bug fix)
3. Complete User Story 2 fully (statistics fix)
4. Complete User Story 3 fully (status management verification)
5. Run Polish phase
6. Final validation and testing

### Alternative: Careful Parallel Strategy

With careful coordination on PvpListener.java:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (onPlayerDamage method)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (onPlayerDeath method) - coordinate on same file
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (verification tasks) - mostly in PlayerManager
3. Stories complete and integrate with merge conflict resolution

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **File conflict warning**: PvpListener.java is modified in US1, US2, and US3 - sequential implementation recommended
- Manual testing scenarios available in quickstart.md
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 49
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 6 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1): 15 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - P2): 8 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - P3): 7 tasks
- Phase 6 (Polish): 9 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 11 tasks marked [P]

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Attack player without killing ‚Üí murderer status applies immediately, name red, armor removed. Same-team attack ‚Üí blocked, no damage.
- **US2**: Kill murderer ‚Üí killer gets kill credit. Kill non-murderer ‚Üí killer gets NO kill credit, only death counted.
- **US3**: Multiple attacks ‚Üí timer accumulates (max 60 min). Timer expires ‚Üí name white, can equip armor. Reconnect ‚Üí status preserved.

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = Core bug fix with immediate murderer status application
