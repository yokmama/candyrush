# Specification Quality Checklist: PVP Restriction Bug Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been verified:

### Content Quality
- ✅ Spec contains no implementation-specific details (Java, Paper API, etc. are not mentioned)
- ✅ All content focuses on what the system must do and why it matters for players
- ✅ Language is accessible to game designers and project managers
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- ✅ All 21 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "MUST detect player-vs-player damage events immediately", "MUST block all damage between same-team players")
- ✅ All 9 success criteria have measurable metrics (e.g., "within 1 second", "100% of attacks", "zero damage dealt")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of event handlers, classes, etc.)
- ✅ Each user story has 3-5 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section covers 8 important boundary conditions including same-team attacks and teamless players
- ✅ Scope is clear: bug fix for PVP restriction system with friendly fire prevention during active gameplay
- ✅ Team-based requirements are clearly specified (same team = no damage, different teams = murderer penalties apply)

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ Requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three user stories cover: immediate penalties with team checks (P1), statistics (P2), and status management (P3)
- ✅ Success criteria directly validate key behaviors: friendly fire prevention (SC-001), timing (SC-002), coverage (SC-003), correctness (SC-004-007), performance (SC-008), security (SC-009)
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction from code structure

## Notes

The specification is ready for the next phase. Updated to include team-based friendly fire prevention.

Key strengths:
1. Clear prioritization with P1 focusing on the critical bug (immediate murderer status on attack)
2. Team-based PvP protection ensuring same-team players cannot damage each other
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage including rapid attacks, murderer-on-murderer combat, same-team attacks, teamless players, and game state transitions
4. Well-defined success criteria that can be validated through testing
5. Detailed functional requirements covering all aspects of the feature including friendly fire prevention

Updated requirements:
- Added FR-002 for same-team damage blocking
- Added acceptance scenario for same-team attack prevention
- Added SC-001 for friendly fire prevention validation
- Added edge cases for same-team attacks and teamless players

Recommendation: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts.
